            <h2>What is Milk Tea?</h2>
            <p>Milk tea, especially bubble tea, is popular among young people for several reasons. Its sweet, creamy taste and chewy tapioca pearls make it delicious and fun to drink. With many flavors and options to customize sweetness and toppings, everyone can have their perfect drink. Milk tea shops have become cool spots to hang out, making the drink a social and cultural trend. Sharing colorful and trendy milk tea pictures on social media also makes it more popular. The caffeine and sugar in it give a quick energy and mood boost, which can be habit-forming.</p>
        <p> Hong Kong milk tea comes from its ties to British milk tea during the colonial era. Since the taste of British milk tea was not very strong, people in Hong Kong changed this drink by adding crushed Ceylon black tea, which is usually called Sri Lanka black tea. Because of its similar pronunciation, Sri Lanka milk tea is then translated to Silang milk tea in Hong Kong. The process of making Silang milk tea has six steps: scraping the tea, boiling the tea, baking the tea, infusing the tea, and adding milk.The tea was put through a sieve as part of the way it was made, which also led to the name "silk hose milk tea". On top of that, evaporated milk was added to the tea to finish the drink. </p>
        <p> Taiwan milk tea is well-known as Bubble milk tea. It was originated in the 17th century, when the Dutch brought it there. The Boba is a round starch powder that looks like a pearl. Before being added to the milk tea, this powder circle is usually dipped in syrup. This is done to make sure that when the powder circle is mixed with the sugary milk tea, it keeps its natural sweetness.[13] Bubble tea has acquired such a significant role in representing Taiwanese culture that the people of Taiwan commemorate April 30 annually as the National Day of Bubble Tea.</p>
    <p> Grassland milk tea is often referred to as salty milk tea because of its preparation. In the pastoral regions of China, such as the Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Tibet, nomadic communities follow the process of initially crushing the tea leaves and subsequently infusing them in boiling water. [10]The tea is then boiled, followed by the addition of milk, which is stirred into the mixture. Finally, an appropriate quantity of salt is incorporated, resulting in the completion of the milk tea preparation. Salt is also used for long term storage as the horde face long-distance travel and extreme weather conditions.</p>
